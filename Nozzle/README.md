For the first study, a bidirectional nozzle model was created in which the flow diameter changed either suddenly or gradually. Particle image velocimetry measurements were acquired in three laboratories using a Newtonian blood analog fluid which matched the refractive index of the nozzle models. The flow rate was adjusted so that the velocity field and pressure along the model could be measured at Reynolds numbers in the nozzle throat which corresponded to laminar (Re = 500), transitional (Re = 2000), and turbulent flow regimes (Re = 3500, 5000, 6500).
