Our benchmark#2 is a simplified centrifugal blood pump. Shown above is an image of the the pump chamber and rotor. The geometry, CAD files, and flow conditions required to run CFD simulations in this device is provided in the “instructions” link below. We built acrylic versions of these pumps, and performed particle image velocimetry experiments to characterize the flow fields in the pump. We also performed blood damage experiments, as well as pump performance (H-Q) tests. Details of the experimental data is provided in the “Data” link below.

Details about geometry, flow conditions, experimental dataset, publications from the working group, acknowledgements, and citations using the benchmarks are provided in the links below
